# yum-vanilla-js
Welcome to Yum, vanilla js! A personal collection of projects written in basic javascript. As a product designer, my goal is to learn to build simple prototypes with animation, interaction and data visualizations. I studied web design back in 2006 using Dreamweaver and Fireworks (yeah, that software) and ended up focusing more on ux design at the time. Now that the resources of learning to program has become more ubiquitous and I am more hungry than ever to build my own stuff - I'm re-learning the programming basics through a combination of textbooks, codeacademy and classes at General Assembly, New York.   

The term "Vanilla JS" was coined as a joke to remind developers that many things can be done nowadays without the need for additional JavaScript libraries such as JQuery. Since 2007, improvements to browser technology means that native CSS and DOM event queries can be supported without the need for the DOM selector in the JS library to do the heavy lifting and smooth out browser inconsistencies.
