# yum-vanilla-js
Yum, vanilla js a personal collection of projects written in basic javascript. As a product designer, my goal is to be able to build simple prototypes with animation, interaction and data visualizations. 

Interesting fact: The term "Vanilla JS" was coined as a joke to remind developers that many things can be done nowadays without the need for additional JavaScript libraries such as JQuery. Since 2007, improvements to browser technology means that native CSS and DOM event queries can be supported without the need for the DOM selector in the JS library to do the heavy lifting and smooth out browser inconsistencies.
